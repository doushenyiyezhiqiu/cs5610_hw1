        Hello, everyone, my name is Liangshe Li. I come from China. I am a current master student at Northeastern University and my major
        is Computer Science. I am interested in basketball, soccer(I prefer to call it football hhh) and computer game. I play league and if 
        you need to find a teammate just call me(lol). For NBA I would support Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics(because now I live in Boston).

    <P> 
        One fun fact about me is that I do not have any girl friend or have a love even I am 25 years old. I know most people might be shy
        about this but I think that is just a fact.
    </P>
